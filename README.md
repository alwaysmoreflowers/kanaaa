### What is it?

In short kanaaa is a project which goal is to help you learn kanas<sup>[?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana)</sup>.

Since japanese characters are unlike the latin alphabet we are used to, it may be hard to remember all of them.

And that is precisely where this project comes in since it can help you to learn hiraganas, katakanas and their diacritic<sup>[?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakuten_and_handakuten)</sup> with surprising ease.

### How do I use it?

Kanaaa was made to be very straight forward and easy to use.

Once you are on kanaaa's website<sup>[right here](https://emmanuelvln.github.io/kanaaa/)</sup> you can chose what you want to focus on thanks to the sliders on top of the page.
> I recommand starting by focusing on learning only hiraganas, next katakanas and only then start mixing them.

In the middle of the screen is displayed a deck of fifteen characters chosen randomly.

By pressing the card you can reveal the prononciation of the character.

Once you feel like you got it, simply press the arrow to go to the next one and so on.

I you have any doubt it is easy to navigate the previously seen characters of the fiteen-card deck.

Once you have circled through a deck you can generate a brand new random deck by pressing the dice button and start again.
> Note: changing your focus with the sliders or reloading the page will also generate new characters.

### That's all folks!

> Do not hesitate to star this repo if kanaaa has been of any use to you ;)
